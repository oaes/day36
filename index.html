            <h2>Dhaka</h2>
            <p>Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national government, trade and culture. The 17th-century old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain. American architect Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis.</p>

            <h2>Population of Dhaka city</h2>
            <p>Dhaka and the municipalities that make up the Greater Dhaka Area have a total population of over 18 million, and the city has shown population growth of about 4.2% annually. The vibrant culture and thousands of Bangladeshi businesses and international corporations has contributed to migration and population growth. However, like many other metropolises in the world, the growing population has led to an increase in pollution, congestion and poverty, amongst other problems.

                    Islam is the dominant religion in Dhaka, with 90% of the population identifying as Muslim. Most Muslims are Sinni, and Admadiya and Shia make up the remainder of the 90%. Hinduism is the second most practiced religion, and Christianity and Buddhism are considered minority religions practiced by some Dhakaites. </p>
